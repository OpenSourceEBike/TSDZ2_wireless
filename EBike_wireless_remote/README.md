- Developers, see the [documentation](documentation/README.md)
- [We have also developed a wireless ebike controller for the TSDZ2 motor](https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2_wireless)
as well as a [bootloader to be used with both the remote control and the ebike wireless controller](https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2_wireless-bootloader)
## Overview
This project implements a wireless remote button for EBikes and/or GPS bike computers like the Garmin Edge. 
You can  purchase on the market ebike remote controls. ie: the [Garmin EBike Remote for about 80â‚¬](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/545795/pn/010-12094-30).

However, our remote control is considerably less expensive and offers sevaral additional features for ebike control.
