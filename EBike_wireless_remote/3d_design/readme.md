For 3D printing, use the files lower_part.stl and keypad.stl. Note that lower_part.stl seems to have non-manifold edges but I generated the GCode on Cura software and it printed well as if non-manifold edges are not an issue.

The other files are the sources files for the design on the FreeCAD 0.19 dev version. The assembly file has the assembly of the parts, including the NRF52 wireless board and the battery.
