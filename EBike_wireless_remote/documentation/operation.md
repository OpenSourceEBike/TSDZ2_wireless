# **Remote operation**

## Getting started with the Wireless remote 

**To get started , follow this simple four step process (or five steps if you have connected the e-brakes):**
(Please note that buttons will briefly flash **RED** if they are inactive)

1. Ensure that the second wireless board is powered up and connected to the TSDZ2 motor controller. Ensure that the remote has a battery connected and press any button to start the pairing process with the motor controller. When the remote is searching for an ANT connection, the RED LED will slowly flash. When a connection is made with the motor, the GREEN LED will short flash twice followed by one long flash to indicate connection.
2. To turn on the motor from the remote control, press and hold the [POWER]() key on the remote control. A  **YELLOW** LED will start flashing, and will continue flashing until the motor is on, at which time a **GREEN** LED will short flash twice followed by one long flash to indicate that the motor is on.
3. press the [PLUS/MINUS]() keys briefly to increase/decrease the motor assist level. The **GREEN** LED will briefly flash on every [PLUS]() press of the button, while the **YELLOW** LED will briefly flash on every [MINUS]() press of the button. There are 7 levels of assist. When you reach level 7 (maximum assist) or level 0 (motor off) the **RED** LED will briefly flash.
4. (Optional step needed you have connected the e-brakes) Depress either the right or left brake lever. The **RED** LED will flash quickly and the motor assist will stop. Release the brake lever and the **RED** led will turn off and the motor assist will resume.
5. To turn off the motor, press and hold the [POWER]() key on the remote control. The **RED** LED will short flash twice, followed by one long flash to indicate the motor is off. The LED will then flash one flash for every 10% of charge remaining in the battery.(ie:5 flashes=50% charge remaining). The flashes will be **RED** from 0%-40%, **YELLOW** from 40%-70%, and **GREEN** from 70% to 100% of charge.

### **That's basically all you need to get started with the wireless remote.**

Read the "**Button Operation (NORMAL MODE)**" section below for more details on the remote's operation when riding your e-bike.

If you would like to configure the remote, please read the "**Remote Operating Modes**" section next. Please note that the remote will control the motor "out of the box" and no configuration is necessary unless you would like to pair a specific bike computer, set specific ANT configurations, or wirelessly update the remote firmware . Most people can safely ignore **CONFIGURATION MODE** and still enjoy full functionality from their remote.

Have Fun!!

## Remote Operating Modes
The remote has two modes of operation; **CONFIGURATION MODE** and **NORMAL MODE**, for configuration and normal operation, respectively.

## CONFIGURATION MODE

----
In **CONFIGURATION MODE**, the remote has a 2 configuration options, namely specifying a specific ANT ID for use with the ebike and setting up ANT LEV control options. Both of these settings are optional as the remote will default to control the TSDZ2 wireless controller without the need to set anything.

* The ANT ID allows you to pair the remote to a specific TSDZ2 motor. The default ANT ID of 0 allows the remote to pair with any TSDZ2 motor within range. Any other number will cause the remote to ONLY pair with a motor with the same ANT ID. This is a useful option if you have multiple ebikes. The ANT ID can be changed by a bluetooth connection to the remote.
* The ANT LEV control options allow you to pair the remote to an ebike alone, (the default option) , a bike computer (like the Garmin Edge series) , or any combination of these devices.
to enter and exit **CONFIGURATION MODE** press and hold the [ENTER]() button for more than 5 seconds. The **BLUE** LED will flash rapidly 10 times to indicate that configuration mode is active, followed by a visual display of ANT  options. The **RED** LED will flash 5 times to indicate TSDZ2 motor control is active, followed by the **GREEN** LED flashing 5 times to indicate that control of Garmin bike computers is active <br>
