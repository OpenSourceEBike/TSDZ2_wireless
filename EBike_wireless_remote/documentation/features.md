# ANT+ Control Features
This wireless remote button implements two ANT+ profiles:
1. the __ANT+ CTRL profile__ allowing it to control the page view on compatible bike computers - see the user manual of your device to see if it supports this profile. The remote will pair with any device that supports this profile. Typically, garmin bike computers support this profile for page control.
   
2. __The ANT+ LEV__ (Light Electric Vehicle) profile allowing the remote to control various features of the eBike including  changing the assist level. 
The remote will work with any eBike that support the ANT+ LEV profile. Of course, the TSDZ2 wireless eBike controller supports the ANT+ LEV profile.
