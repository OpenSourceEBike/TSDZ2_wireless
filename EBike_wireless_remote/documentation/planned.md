# Further Developments and Planned Features

  * Other possible ANT+ button assignments:
    * ie: Light control
    * Turn signal indication
    * Throttle Control of the TSDZ2 motor
  * Low battery  indication
  * Design a suitable housing for the board and battery.
  For this, two options are currently being considered:
    1. __The design of a suitable spacer for 3D printing that can reuse the VLCD5 keypad and handlebar connector__ (basically, the top and bottom portions of the keypad)  Inital design attempts are located in the 3d_design folder. 
    2. __The design of a seperate housing for the board + coin battery__. This has the advantage of allowing the board LED to be visible and the possible use of a larger battery for even longer life.
   No design efforts have started on this option. If you would like to contribute to this effort, please let us know in the [forum](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=106346).
